## About The Project

ConnectSphere is a client application that demonstrates key iOS development skills. It fetches a list of users from a network endpoint, parses the complex JSON data, and presents it in a clean, multi-screen, navigable interface. The main goal was to practice data fetching, decoding, and presentation using modern SwiftUI techniques.

## Features

- **Fetches user data** from a remote API using `URLSession`.
- **Parses complex JSON** into Swift models using `Codable`.
- **Handles advanced data types**, including `UUID` and `ISO8601` formatted dates.
- **Displays a master list** of users with their online status.
- **Provides a detail view** for each user, showing comprehensive information including their list of friends.
- **Built entirely with SwiftUI**, using modern tools like `async/await` and `NavigationStack`.

## Technologies Used

- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
- **Networking:** URLSession with `async/await`
- **Data Parsing:** Codable
- **Navigation:** NavigationStack
- **Language:** Swift

This project was built as part of my learning journey with the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course.
